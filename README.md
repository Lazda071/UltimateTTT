A very simple game of Ultimate Tic Tac Toe
Ultimate Tic Tac Toe is a game played on a larger 3x3 grid, with each square containing a smaller 3x3 tic-tac-toe board. Players take turns placing their mark (X or O) in one of the smaller boards, but the next player is forced to play in the smaller board corresponding to the square where the previous player placed their mark. The first player to win three small boards in a row on the larger grid wins the game. You place Xs and Os by clicking on a legal square. The game will alert you if the move is illegal and tell you why.
